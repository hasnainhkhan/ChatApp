Basic AI Model Ollama
# AI Chat with RGB Animation

This project is a simple **AI chat application** where users can interact with an AI model by sending text input. The AI responds with an animated typing effect, where each word appears in a **RGB color cycle** and transitions to black after 0.5 seconds. This is designed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to provide a smooth, interactive experience.

## About the Project

The **AI Chat with RGB Animation** is a lightweight web application that simulates a chat experience with an AI model. The application provides real-time user and AI interaction, with messages animated in RGB colors to enhance the visual appeal. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate a visually engaging user interface while keeping the backend interaction simple and easy to integrate with any AI API (e.g., GPT models).

### Key Features

- **User Interaction**: Users can send messages to the AI.
- **RGB Animation**: The AI's response text animates with a smooth RGB color change.
- **Word Limit**: A limit on the number of words per user input.
- **Stop Response**: Users can stop the AI's response at any time using the "Stop Response" button.
- **Typing Effect**: The AI responds with a typing animation, displaying one word at a time.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating animations, including the RGB text animation.
- **JavaScript**: To handle dynamic interactions, API calls, and animations.
- **Backend Integration**: The AI backend can be any model (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT) that processes the user input and returns a response.

### Frameworks and Libraries

- **None**: This project does not use external frameworks like React or Angular. It relies on basic front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. However, it can be easily extended to integrate with a backend framework such as **Spring Boot**, **Node.js**, or **Flask**.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user types a message and presses the "Send" button.
2. **AI Response**: The message is sent to the backend (API call), and the AI starts typing its response.
3. **RGB Animation**: The AI’s message is displayed word by word with a rotating RGB color effect.
4. **Black Transition**: After the AI finishes typing, the message turns black after 0.5 seconds.
